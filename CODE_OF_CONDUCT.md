Code of Conduct
===============

Act in a way that you'll be proud of now, tomorrow and years from now and always remember 
that there's a face behind the cold words on a screen ðŸ––.

Enforcement
-----------

There won't be any enforcement of the code of conduct simply because the nature of decentralized,
open-source projects is such that it can't be (and shouldn't be). Be design, you'll always be free
to take ideas that might conflict with the current's owner by `forking` and self-organizing around your own.
