// Package assertplugin provides testing functions to validate a plugin's overall functionality.
// This package is designed to play well but not require the assertanswer package for validation
// of answers
//
// Note that all commands and hearActions are evaluated by assertplugin's driver but this is a
// simplified version of how slackscot actually drives plugins and aims to provide the minimal
// processing required to allow a plugin to test functionality given an incoming message.
// Users should take special care to use include <@botUserID> with the same botUserID with which the
// plugin driver has been instantiated in the message text inputs to test commands (or include a
// channel name that starts with D for direct channel testing)
